# This is the same ID that you've used in meson.build and other files
app-id: com.github.jeremypw.Skeleton

# Instead of manually specifying a long list of build and runtime dependencies,
# we can use a convenient pre-made runtime and SDK. For this example, we'll be
# using the runtime and SDK provided by elementary.
runtime: io.elementary.Platform
runtime-version: '7'
sdk: io.elementary.Sdk

# This should match the exec line in your .desktop file and usually is the same
# as your app ID
command: com.github.jeremypw.skeleton

# Here we can specify the kinds of permissions our app needs to run. Since we're
# not using hardware like webcams, making sound, or reading external files, we
# only need permission to draw our app on screen using either X11 or Wayland.
finish-args:
# X11 + XShm access
  - '--share=ipc'
  - '--socket=fallback-x11'
# Wayland access
  - '--socket=wayland'
  - '--device=dri' ## Required for Gtk4/OpenGL

# If need to talk to the network:
  # - --share=network
# If need to save files to local e.g. user documents folder
  # - --filesystem=xdg-documents

# This section is where you list all the source code required to build your app.
# If we had external dependencies that weren't included in our SDK, we would list
# them here.
